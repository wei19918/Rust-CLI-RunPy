# Rust CLI Project
by meswsoul, 2024

## Introduction
This project is a modified version of [Pet CLI](`https://github.com/zupzup/rust-commandline-example`), originally created by [Zupan].

On top of the Rust TUI example, I made a CLI tool for python scripts management. 
Added features include:
- .env support
- initialize db and error handling
- run scripts
- return stdour stderr result logs

Example: Run a script
